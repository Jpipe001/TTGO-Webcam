+ Had to rebuild the code to restore the original function.
+ This is based on the example program in the IDE. (File/Examples/ESP32/Camera/CameraWebServer)
+ The pin configuration is inluded in this sketch.
+ But the display app (app_httpd.ccp) needs to be copied to the same folder as the sketch.
 The easiest way is to load the example in the IDE and replace the ino file with the one here.
+ Uses the U8xlib OLED Driver from https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino.  Thankyou Oli.

+ This web page has a logical local web address which is configurable.
